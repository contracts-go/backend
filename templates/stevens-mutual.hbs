<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"><b>CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT &ndash; (Mutual)</b></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT</strong> is made as of the {{dateString}}, by and between Stevens Institute,  by and between {{company.name}}, a {{company.type}} {{company.state}} having its principal offices located at {{company.location}}  (the "Company"), and <strong>THE TRUSTEES OF THE STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY</strong>, a New Jersey non-profit university, having its principal offices located at One Castle Point on Hudson, 13th Floor, Hoboken, New Jersey 07030.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS</strong>, Stevens engages in various activities as part of its non-profit research and educational mission which involve {{project.industry}} {{#if otherRearchEntities}} and {{otherResearchEntitites}}{{/if}} and may, from time to time, involve the exchange of confidential or proprietary information by both parties;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS</strong>, the parties have determined that they wish to exchange confidential and/or proprietary information for the purpose of evaluating the possibility of a research or other relationship between the parties relating to {{project.description}} (the "Project");</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE,</strong> in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <strong>"Discloser"</strong> and <strong>"Recipient"</strong> mean the parties hereto who may be disclosing or receiving the Confidential Information, as applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As used herein, <strong>"Confidential Information"</strong> means all data, reports, interpretations, forecasts, records, research samples of any nature, including without limitation, proprietary software and related intellectual property, proprietary technology, and any other information (written or oral) regarding the Discloser or any of its affiliates or their respective research, properties or other activities which is not available to the general public and which the Discloser or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives (collectively, <strong>"Representatives"</strong>) provides to the Recipient or any of its Representatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In order to be treated as Confidential Information, such information or materials must be marked "confidential" and may only be delivered to an Authorized Person of the other party. The following persons shall be Authorized Persons for purposes of this Agreement (i) on behalf of the Company, {{company.name}}, and any person named as an Authorized Person in writing (which may be email) by {{pi.name}} and (ii) on behalf of Stevens, {{pi.name}}, and any person named as an Authorized Person in writing (which may be email) by Stevens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Confidential Information shall not include information that (i)&nbsp;has become generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or any of its Representatives, (ii)&nbsp;was available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the Recipient by the Discloser or its Representatives, (iii)&nbsp;was independently developed by the Recipient or its Representatives, (iv)&nbsp;has become available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Discloser or its Representatives or (v) is required to be disclosed by applicable law or judicial process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Each party agrees that Confidential Information shall be used only for the purposes provided herein. The Recipient shall use the same degree of care as it uses with respect to its own confidential information (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care) and to hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose Confidential Information to third parties, or use the Confidential Information except for purposes of this Agreement, in each case without the written consent of the Discloser for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its Representatives who have a need to know the Information for purposes of this Agreement. Each such Representative shall be informed by the Recipient of the confidential nature of such Information and shall be directed to treat the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS THAT, EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE EXPRESSLY AGREED IN WRITING, THE DISCLOSER DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR NON-INFRINGING STATUS OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. No right or license is granted hereby to the Recipient, expressly or by implication, with respect to the Confidential Information, or any patent, patent application or other proprietary right of the Discloser, notwithstanding the termination of the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Each party will, promptly upon the request of the other party, deliver to that Party any and all documents and materials comprising such party&rsquo;s Confidential Information or any part thereof and will destroy any copies, notes or extracts thereof, without retaining any copy thereof, or destroy such documents and materials upon such party&rsquo;s request (such destruction to be confirmed in writing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING LOSS OF ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, DATA OR INACCURACY OF DATA IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT INCLUDING STRICT TORT LIABILITY OR BASED UPON A WARRANTY) UNDER WHICH THE LIABILITY MAY BE ASSERTED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles or rules. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New Jersey and of the United States of America located in New Jersey for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. certified mail to its address set forth in the preamble to this Agreement shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against it in any such court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements or understandings between the parties about the exchange and protection of Confidential Information provided under this Agreement. If any of the provisions of this Agreement are not enforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. No failure or delay in exercising any other right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. No amendment or modification to this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by both parties. This Agreement may be signed in separate counterparts which, together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. This Agreement does not constitute an export license, and each party remains responsible for its own compliance with any restrictions or other requirements imposed by any and all export control statutes, regulations, and other requirements.</p>
